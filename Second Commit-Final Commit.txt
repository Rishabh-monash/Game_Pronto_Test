*** Second Commit - Final Commit ****
 
In the second , I created Robot Class.  Robot Class is for for defining the direction, distance traveled of the robot based on the commands passed from RemoteInputCommand class. 
In addition, it calculates the minimum distance required for the robot to get back to the original position.
  
(1) getMinimumUnits() : For calculating the distance that the robot is required to get back to the original position.
(2) getCurrentDirection():  For defining the direction of the robot.
